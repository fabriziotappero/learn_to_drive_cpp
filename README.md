A C++ implementation of an **artificial intelligence** that can drive at unbelievable speed on *any* given circuit!

# How to compile
Install g++ (in Windows you can use MSYS2) and run:

    g++ -o main.exe main.cpp -O2 -s -DNDEBUG -luser32 -lgdi32 -lopengl32 -lgdiplus -lShlwapi -ldwmapi -lstdc++fs -static -std=c++17

 # What it does
You give it a race circuit (as an PNG prite) and you let the car learn how to drive. After a cetain amount of iterations the car will be able to drive al maximum speed around the circuit!
 
 As you might have noticed from the code, it uses the great open-source **Pixel Game Engine** by olc. Have a look here for into and documentation:

 ## How to feed the AI
 In order for the AI to learn, it is necessay to feed information regarding the sorrounding as well as information regarding what it is considered good driving. Here is what the car sees when racing.

 # Why I made this
 Essentially I wanted to improve my C++ skills by implementing an *articial intelligence* that can process images in real time using a *graphic game engine*. 
 If you actually want to implement stuff it is a good idea to find data to process, a game engine has indeed a ton of video data!
 
 Regarding AI, on the web you can find a lot of implementations made in Python but not so many made in C++.
 
 # What I have learnt
 - How to draw stuff on a screen, meaning, how to use a simple graphical game engine. This is one step above GUI development where frame rate and code 
 efficiency are your constant worry.
 - How to structure a series of C++ classes and functions so that you can integrate a well established software tool (in this case the Game Engine tool) 
 in your own development. This is a particular important skill since a lot of coding that you end up doing is via the use of tools, API or software that 
 others have built.
 - How to implement from scratch an AI in C++. Learn the ins and outs of reinforced learning and the importance of input data (not implemented yet).
 - How to deal with C++ Standard Library tools instead of writing up your own.
